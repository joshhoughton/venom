*I've made a Chrome extension for quick timestamping Spotify, YouTube and SoundCloud music all in one place.*

Ever deep into work and hear a banger come on in a DJ set?

Venom lets you instantly bookmark any playing media at the press of a keyboard shortcut, so that you can come back to it later and identify what's playing.

The extension is currently only released on Chrome but can port to other browsers if there is demand. Let me know of any feature requests or feedback.
